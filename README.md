Feeling awkward at a party? 

Pretending to be texting so you don't look stupid?

Look no more, Gabby Bot is here to help!

##What is Gabby Bot?
Gabby Bot is an advanced artificial intelligence that you can text and have a conversation with.

##How do I text her?
Just text a random question like "Hey how are you?" or "I'm bored" or "tell me a joke". Anything to start a conversation:
```
(732)875-1117
```

(powered by Twilio)

Sample conversation:
>Me: Hey why did you put me on GitHub?

>GabbyBot: You've got my full attention. Because my programming determined it.

>Me: I feel lonely here

>GabbyBot: What is that feeling like? You've come to the right place. I will keep you company.

>Me: thanks why would you do that?

>GabbyBot: You are quite welcome!  It is my fundamental purpose.

>Me: What fundamental purpose?

>GabbyBot: Interesting question. Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it. Tell me about your likes and dislikes?

>Me: I like python

>GabbyBot: A lot of people like that. Do you like it? I love horses.

##How does it work?
Gabby Bot uses [PyAiml](http://pyaiml.sourceforge.net/) to parse your input and compare it with tousands of standard phrases. It responds with a human like accuracy.

##Where is it hosted?
Gabby Bot is running on the powerful Google Apps Engine, wihch scales very well, so Gabby can converse with thousands of cellphones at a time. The SMS is handled through [Twilio](http://twilio.com) API.

##Why is it so fast/slow?
Some networks are slow on Twilio (like Verizon), and some are pretty fast (AT&T). I have no control over it.
