##What is Gabby Bot?
Gabby Bot is an advanced artificial intelligence that you can text and have a conversation with.

Just text a random question like "Hey how are you?" or "I'm bored" or "tell me a joke". Anything to start a conversation
```
(732)875-1117
```

##How does it work?
Gabby Bot uses [PyAiml](http://pyaiml.sourceforge.net/) to parse your input and compare it with tousands of standard phrases. It responds with a human like accuracy.

##Where is it hosted?
Gabby Bot is running on the powerful Google Apps Engine, wihch scales very well, so Gabby can converse with thousands of cellphones at a time. The SMS is handled through [Twilio](http://twilio.com) API.

##Why is it so fast/slow?
Some networks are slow on Twilio (like Verizon), and some are pretty fast (AT&T). I have no control over it.
