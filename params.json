Anything to start a conversation\r\n```\r\n(732)875-1117\r\n```\r\n\r\n##How does it work?\r\nGabby Bot uses [PyAiml](http://pyaiml.sourceforge.net/) to parse your input and compare it with tousands of standard phrases. It responds with a human like accuracy.\r\n\r\n##Where is it hosted?\r\nGabby Bot is running on the powerful Google Apps Engine, wihch scales very well, so Gabby can converse with thousands of cellphones at a time. The SMS is handled through [Twilio](http://twilio.com) API.\r\n\r\n##Why is it so fast/slow?\r\nSome networks are slow on Twilio (like Verizon), and some are pretty fast (AT&T). I have no control over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/home?status=Gabby%20Bot:%20you'll%20never%20have%20to%20pretend%20to%20text%20someone%20again:%20http://xiaoxu193.github.io/gabbybot/%20@xiaoxu0)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
